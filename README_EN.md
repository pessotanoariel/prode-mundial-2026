# World Cup Forecast Atlas

Interactive simulation and forecasting platform for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Built with Python, Elo Ratings, Monte Carlo simulation, Expected Goals (xG), Poisson score modeling, and Streamlit.

## Atlas Experience

The project includes an editorial-style interactive Atlas that transforms simulation outputs into a digital tournament magazine.

### Included Sections

- Cover
- Atlas
- Groups
- Bracket
- Matches
- Method

Instead of presenting predictions as traditional dashboards, the Atlas organizes forecasts, standings, probabilities, and knockout projections into a narrative experience inspired by classic World Cup guides.

---

## Project Goals

- Consume and process international football datasets based on Elo Ratings.
- Generate match forecasts using team strength and recent form.
- Simulate the complete FIFA World Cup 2026.
- Determine qualification using the official 48-team format.
- Implement FIFA Annex C knockout mapping.
- Simulate all knockout rounds through the Final.
- Explore tournament outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation.
- Serve as a practical project for Python, data engineering, simulation modeling, testing, and product design.
